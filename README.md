Zomato Data Analysis Project Using Python

About the Project:-
Hello, I am Ahamad. In today's fast-paced digital world, food delivery platforms like Zomato play a crucial role in shaping customer dining experiences. With an abundance of restaurants to choose from, understanding customer preferences, spending habits, and ordering trends is essential for business growth.
In this project, I will analyze a real-world dataset of Zomato customer orders to uncover valuable insights. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques, I will identify patterns that can help optimize business strategies and improve customer satisfaction. 

Objectives:-
This project aims to answer the following key questions:
Customer Preferences: What types of restaurants do most customers prefer to order from?
Voting Trends: How many votes has each restaurant type received?
Restaurant Ratings: What are the common ratings given to different restaurant types?
Spending Behavior: Zomato has observed that couples frequently order food online. What is their average spending per order?
Order Mode Comparison: Which ordering mode (online vs. offline) has received the highest ratings?
Offline Ordering Trends: Which restaurant type receives the most offline orders, and how can Zomato tailor offers for these customers?
By answering these questions, this analysis will provide actionable insights that can help Zomato enhance its service, create targeted marketing strategies, and deliver a seamless customer experience.
